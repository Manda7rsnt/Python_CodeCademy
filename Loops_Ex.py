# A common application of a while loop is to check user input to see if it is valid. For example,
# if you ask the user to enter y or n and they instead enter 7, then you should re-prompt them for input.

# Fill in the loop condition so the user will be prompted for a choice over and over while choice 
# does not equal 'y' and choice does not equal 'n'.

# The break is a one-line statement that means "exit the current loop." An alternate way to make our 
# counting loop exit and stop executing is with the break statement.

# First, create a while with a condition that is always true. The simplest way is shown.
# Using an if statement, you define the stopping condition. Inside the if, you write break, meaning "exit the loop."
# The difference here is that this loop is guaranteed to run at least once.

# While / else
# while/else is similar to if/else, but there is a difference: the else block will execute 
# anytime the loop condition is evaluated to False. This means that it will execute if the loop 
# is never entered or if the loop exits normally. If the loop exits as the result of a break, 
# the else will not be executed.

# In below example, the loop will break if a 5 is generated, and the else will not execute. 
# Otherwise, after 3 numbers are generated, the loop condition will become false and the else will execute.

# A weakness of using this for-each style of iteration is that you don't know the index of the 
# thing you're looking at. Generally this isn't an issue, but at times it is useful to know how 
# far into the list you are. Thankfully the built-in enumerate function helps with this.
#
# enumerate works by supplying a corresponding index to each element in the list that you pass 
# it. Each time you go through the loop, index will be one greater, and item will be the next 
# item in the sequence. It's very similar to using a normal for loop with a list, except this 
# gives us an easy way to count how many items we've seen so far.

# We don't want the user to see things listed from index 0, since this looks unnatural.

choices = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad', 'nachos']

print 'Your choices are:'
for index, item in enumerate(choices):
    print index+1, item 
	
# It's also common to need to iterate over two lists at once. This is where the built-in zip function comes 
# in handy. zip will create pairs of elements when passed two lists, and will stop at the end of the shorter 
# list. zip can handle three or more lists as well!

# Compare each pair of elements and print the larger of the two.
list_a = [3, 9, 17, 15, 19]
list_b = [2, 4, 8, 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

# For / else
# Just like with while, for loops may have an else associated with them.
# In this case, the else statement is executed after the for, but only if the for ends 
# normallyâ€”that is, not with a break. This code will break when it hits 'tomato', so the 
# else block won't be executed.
